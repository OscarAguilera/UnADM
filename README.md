# UnADM 
This project is for academic purposes only for the [UnADM](https://www.unadmexico.mx/) rder to start it, thi is in case that you fork the original.

# Use it Wisely 

Use it wisely, do not try just to copy and paste the code to take advantage and make progress into the class, that is not the idea, the idea is to use all the resources available.

## My Description 
My name is Oscar Aguilera Huerta and I am a UnADM student, I belong to the program of  [Software Development](https://www.unadmexico.mx/index.php/licenciaturas/desarrollo-de-software), in the time previous to join to the UnADM I has been working and gain experience since I am a TSU in Telematic graduated from the [UTM](http://www.utmetropolitana.edu.mx/),  I worked with CA Service Desk, also as Help Desk and Tech Support, Sys Admin, DevOps at Epicor, and now I am working as DevOps at [DigitalOnUs](https://www.digitalonus.com/) where I am developing more my skills with my new Family.
